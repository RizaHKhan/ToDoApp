# ToDoApp
Simple and elegant To Do App

WHAT I LEARNT
1. DOM traversing
2. Using CSS to manipulate HTML elements (if firstChild or lastChild of list, prevent clicks).
3. Elegant design

WHAT COULD BE IMRPOVED
1. No local storage at this point
2. No Exporting feature (I tried, but could not get it to work). 
3. Not properly optomized for smaller screens
